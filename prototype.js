The Houdini Pipeline Developerâ€™s perspective is high level and forward looking. Demonstrated ability to prioritize, partner and implement new and improved technologies, the Houdini Pipeline Developer has advanced skills with Houdini, Python and C++ required for research, development and mentoring others. The Houdini Pipeline Developer will be required to work with FX artists to design and implement tools to effectively move assets between 3DS Max and Houdini, improve the efficiency of our FX workflow, and ensure accurate output in ways that mesh well with current tools and workflows.`;
